The issue is that you‚Äôve included the entire README inside a code block (` ```markdown `), which causes GitHub to render it as plain text instead of Markdown. That‚Äôs why your headings, bold text, and links aren't formatting properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix it by **removing the code block markers** (the lines with triple backticks):

In your current README, this:

<pre>
```markdown
# **Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer**
...
``` 
</pre>

Should become:

````markdown
# **Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer**

A web app to analyze the sentiment of Netflix show and movie reviews using natural language processing.

## Overview

This app allows users to:
- Upload a CSV file containing reviews
- Analyze individual reviews
- Visualize sentiment distribution
- Compare sentiment across different shows

Built with **Streamlit**, **TextBlob**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

- Upload reviews in bulk via CSV
- Predict sentiment for custom input
- Auto-generate missing titles and years
- Interactive charts:

Once you do this and save the README, GitHub will properly render headings, bold text, links, and code blocks.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to update your README.md file for you.
