# Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer

A Streamlit web application for performing sentiment analysis on IMDb-style reviews of Netflix shows and movies using TextBlob. Users can upload a custom dataset, write their own reviews, explore sentiment distributions, and compare shows side-by-side. The app also assigns random Netflix show titles and release years to create a realistic visual experience when those fields are missing.

## Live Demo

**[Open Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer](https://your-deployed-app-url.streamlit.app)**
_(Replace this link with your actual deployed URL)_

## Features

- Upload a CSV dataset of reviews with sentiments
- Analyze your own review in real-time
- Assigns fake Netflix show titles and release years if missing
- Visualizes:

  - Overall sentiment distribution (bar chart)
  - Sentiment breakdown for a selected show (pie chart)
  - Sentiment comparison between two shows (side-by-side bar chart)

---

## Dataset Requirements

Your uploaded CSV should have the following columns:

Required:

- `review`: The text content of the review
- `sentiment`: Either `positive` or `negative`

Optional:

- `title`: Show or movie title
- `year`: Release year

If `title` and `year` are not provided, the app randomly assigns values from a predefined list of Netflix show names and years (2015â€“2023).

### Example:

```csv
review,sentiment,title,year
"Amazing storytelling and acting.",positive,Dark,2018
"Too slow and unengaging.",negative,,
```

## How It Works

- Sentiment is calculated using **TextBlob**
- Custom reviews return `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral` based on polarity
- Dataset reviews are filtered to only include `Positive` or `Negative` entries
- Missing metadata is filled with fake but realistic values for visual impact
- Matplotlib is used for rendering bar and pie charts
