# Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project is a web-based sentiment analysis tool developed using Streamlit. It analyzes IMDb-style reviews for Netflix shows and movies using the TextBlob library. Users can upload their own datasets, write and analyze custom reviews, explore sentiment distributions, and compare reviews across different titles. The application also assigns show titles and release years when they are not provided in the data, for a more complete experience.

## Live Demo

Access the deployed application at the following link:
**[Netflix Review Sentiment Analyzer](https://your-deployed-app-url.streamlit.app)**
*Note: Replace this URL with your actual deployment link.*

---

## Features

* Upload and process CSV files containing reviews and sentiment labels
* Analyze individual reviews through real-time sentiment detection
* Automatically assign show titles and release years if missing
* Visualize data using:

  * Overall sentiment distribution (bar chart)
  * Sentiment breakdown by show (pie chart)
  * Sentiment comparison between two shows (side-by-side bar chart)

---

## Dataset Format

The uploaded CSV file must include the following columns:

**Required Columns**

* `review`: The text of the review
* `sentiment`: The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`)

**Optional Columns**

* `title`: The name of the show or movie
* `year`: The release year

If `title` and `year` are not provided, the application will randomly assign them from predefined lists.

**Example CSV**

```csv
review,sentiment,title,year
"Amazing storytelling and acting.",positive,Dark,2018
"Too slow and unengaging.",negative,,
```

---

## How It Works

* The application uses the TextBlob library to calculate polarity and determine sentiment
* Reviews written by the user are labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
* Dataset reviews are filtered to include only Positive or Negative sentiments
* Visualizations are created using Matplotlib
